<h1>Singing with Csound</h1>
First released, in 1986, CSOUND is a audio programming language used to model and synthesize sound.

<p>
The language contains many opcodes to allow the creation of complex instruments.
One such opcode is the 'fof' opcode, which produces sinusoid bursts and can be used for formant synthesis.
Human vowel sounds can be synthesized using this opcode.

<p>
The examples below demonstrate the use of the 'fof' opcode to synthesize singing vowel sounds, acting as an instrument in midi songs.

<p>
Csound source used to translate synth voice and choir voice instruments into 'fof' based instrument, while routing other instruments through the fluid soft synthesizer engine: <a href="midi_fluid_voice.csd">midi_fluid_voice.csd</a>

Star Trek midi converted to contain a synth voice instrument: <a href="startrek_voice.mid">startrek_voice.mid</a>

<p>
Result, converted to mp3: <a href="startrek_voice.mp3">startrek_voice.mp3</a>

Nirvana "Lithium" midi converted to contain a synth voice instrument: <a href="lithium_voice.mid">lithium_voice.mid</a>

<p>
Result, converted to mp3: <a href="lithium_voice.mp3">lithium_voice.mp3</a>

<p>Note that here, the synth voice instrument is interpreted as a "wah" voice, where the start of group of notes starts with a "w" ( a short oo sound), and continued notes produce an "ah" sound.

Many thanks to the authors of Csound, and the examples (fofx6.csd, fluidcomplex.csd) which the above csd builds upon. Thanks also the the OLPC csound team which also provided useful examples (gm.csd) and documentation.
