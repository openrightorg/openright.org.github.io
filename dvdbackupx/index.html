<h1>dvdbackupx</h1>


<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>
dvdbackupx is a version of dvdbackup modified to find unused blocks and
seek past them, potentially avoiding bad sectors. Unused blocks are found
by using the libdvdnav vm (called libdvdvm here, but not really an independent
library ) to simulate the execution of pre,post and cell commands to follow
each title in the title set.

<p>
The intended use of this is to avoid potentially bad sectors that are perhaps
created by disc manufacturers attempting to prevent consumer fair use or
otherwise subverting the "limited time" copyright condition of the US
constitution.

<h3>Usage:</h3>

dvdbackup -r u -M -i /dev/dvd -o /outdir

<a href="dvdbackupx-0.2-2.tar.gz">dvdbackupx-0.2-2</a> is based on dvdbackup-0.2-2 and libdvdnav-4.1.3. With this version, all commands are processed by the vm. Some changes (<a href="libdvdnav-4.1.3-vm.patch">libdvdnav-4.1.3-vm.patch</a>) were required to libdvdnav/libdvdvm to make this possible.

<i>Old versions.</i>
<p>
The following versions used primative command parsing to predetermine if commands should be skipped or processed by the vm. This is not entirely correct, as comparisons are ignored in the determination, and other vm behavior is possibly missed when skipping commands.</i>
