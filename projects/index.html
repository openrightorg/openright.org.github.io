<h3>Klaatu (2014) </h3>

Kaatu is a minimal Linux which reuses the hardware support provided in an Android release, while removing Dalvik and above. This provides a minimal embedded Linux system supported by Android vendor support, while keeping flexibility of user interfaces (including headless, Kivy, qt/qml, and others) or other customizations.

<h3>Apandor (2014)</h3>

apandor - experimental player that communicates using a subset of the pandora bluetooth protocol. Reverse engineered from automotive and mobile communication.

<h3>NodeJS/JS development example (2013)</h3>

<a href="nodejs/nodejs_development_example.html">nodejs example</a>

<h3>Wavelet experiments</h3>

I had worked on C and Python/Pylab programs to analyze and manipulate sound using Continuous Wavelet Transforms.

(If interested, I can find and post the source).

<h3>Client-side Javascript .chopro parser</h3>

See chordpro.js and examples at <a href="http://jam.openright.org/">jam.openright.org</a>, to see how JavaScript (in the client browser) can be used to convert .chopro text files into pretty guitar music. Use "View Source" to see the original .chopro text.

<h3>CSound experiments</h3>

CSound is an audio programming language released in 1986, yet can perform quite advance sound creation and manipulation. Here are two potentially interesting uses of Csound:

<h4>Singing with CSound</h4>

See <a href="http://csound.openright.org/">"Singing with Csound"</a> to learn how I used CSound to create music with a modeled synthesized Singing voice that replaces a MIDI instrument. 

<h4>Atari Pokey simulation using CSound</h4>

See <a href="http://sap.openright.org/">"Atari Pokey to Csound Conversion"</a> to learn how I used CSound to simulate Atari Pokey sound synthesis either in real time with a modified atari800 emulator or offline using previously captured SAP files.

<h3>DVD backup X</h3>
<a href="http://dvdbackupx.openright.org/">dvdbackupx</a> is a version of dvdbackup that uses libdvdnav to find and skip unused blocks to avoid potentially bad sectors.

<h3>Linux Kernel based (iptables/netfilter) based UDP relay</h3>
<a href="http://relay.openright.org/">ipt_relay</a> is a netfilter kernel module and IP tables modification that allow a high volume of UDP packages to be relayed through the kernel.

<h3>WebKNotes</h3>
<a href="http://webknotes.sf.net/">WebKNotes</a> is a somewhat obsolete web/perl based knowledge database. I am in the process of rewriting a replacement system, which is entirely client-side Javascript. All markup parsing will be performed on the client side (for .wiki, .chopro, ...). The only requirement from the server is HTTP PUT, and HTTP DELETE (other HTTP/Webdav verbs may also be used). I have a somewhat working prototype.

<h3>Perl/Linux</h3>
<a href="http://perllinux.sf.net/">Perl/Linux</a> is a Linux distribution where all user space programs are written in Perl. While this was potentially useful for an embedded platform, it was mostly just a fun project.

<h3>MinCrossLinux</h3>
<a href="http://mincrosslinux.sf.net/">MinCrossLinux</a> was an embedded, package based Linux distribution build system. It was used on NSLU2 and WDTV devices, but is not maintained. I would instead suggest the openwrt or openembedded depending on your requirements.

<h3>NFTE</h3>
<a href="http://nfte.sf.net/">NFTE</a> is a modification of the FTE to create a minimal yet intuitive editor (think DOS edit). I also created the NCurses frontend.

<h3>Other projects (very old)</h3>
I have made contributions to several other open source projects including NMEAP, Konsole, BOA, Intermezzo, XPilot, FVWM.
